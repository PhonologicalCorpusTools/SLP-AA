.. _add_signs:

Adding signs to an existing corpus
`````````````````
To add new signs to an existing corpus, go to "Menu" and select "Load corpus...". This allows you to search your
computer. Only files with the extension ".corpus" are available for selection. Click on a corpus that you would like to
work on, and click "Open".

Alternatively, if you start transcribing a new sign without loading a corpus beforehand, you will get a warning message
when you try to save the sign. You can load an corpus after the message (see :ref:`save_sign`).


.. _delete_signs:

Deleting a sign
`````````````````
To delete a sign from a corpus, click on the sign in the "corpus" column on the right, and check the "Gloss" box to make sure
that your intended sign is loaded. Then click the "Delete word from corpus" button. Note that this option does not give you
a confirmation message and that a deleted sign cannot be recovered.


.. _export_corpus:

Exporting a corpus
`````````````````
To export a corpus, go to Menu and select "Export corpus as cvx..." A new window titled "Export corpus" will appear.
