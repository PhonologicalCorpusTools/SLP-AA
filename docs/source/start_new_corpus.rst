.. _fill_slot:

1. Filling in a slot
`````````````````
To fill in a slot, you can either select a symbol in the pull-down menu or type in 
a symbol yourself.

      Notes on typing in a symbol

      * Slots are generally case-insensitive. An exeption is Slot 11, which permits both "m" and "M".
      * In Slots 20, 25, and 30, use the key 'z' for "x-"; 'c' for "x+"; and 's' for "â˜’".

.. _flag_slot:

2. Flagging a slot
`````````````````
You can optionally flag individual slots. "Flag as uncertain" will colour the slot, and 
"Flag as estimate" will mark the slot with a dotted line. To do this, click on a slot 
while holding a control key. A pull-down menu will appear, and you can select or unselect these options:

"Flag as uncertain" is intended to stand for the transcriber's subjective uncertainty about their choice of a sylbol. "Flag as estimate" is intended to note that, because of obscurity, a symbol has been estimated in some way (based on knpowledge of hand anatomy, a preceeding hand configuration, the other hand in a two-handed symmetrical sign, etc.). Therefore, it is certainly possible to use these two options simultaneously when the transcriber is uncertain about their estimation.
