.. _fill_slot:

1. Filling in a slot
`````````````````
To fill in a slot, you can either click on a slot to select a symbol from the pull-down menu or type in 
a symbol yourself. For more infomation about slots and symbols, see :ref:`field_and_slot`

      Notes on typing in a symbol
      
      * Slots are generally case-insensitive. An exeption is Slot 11, which permits both "m" and "M".
      
      * In Slots 20, 25, and 30, use the key 'z' for "x-"; 'c' for "x+"; and 's' for "â˜’".
      
      * For Mac users, it may be helpful to use the Tab key to move to the next slot. To enable this, go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts. At the bottom of the page under Full Keyboard Access, select "All controls."

.. _flag_slot:

2. Flagging a slot
`````````````````
You can optionally flag individual slots. "Flag as uncertain" will colour the slot, and 
"Flag as estimate" will mark the slot with a dotted line. 

To do this, control-click or rightclick a slot. A pull-down menu will appear, and you can select or unselect these options:

   :align: center

Alternatively, go to Transcription in the menu bar and select "Set transcription flags...". A new window will appear. You can expand and scroll through the window to flag any slot in any Config. Click OK.

"Flag as uncertain" is intended to stand for the transcriber's subjective uncertainty about their choice of a sylbol. "Flag as estimate" is intended to note that, because of obscurity, a symbol has been estimated in some way (based on knpowledge of hand anatomy, a preceeding hand configuration, the other hand in a two-handed symmetrical sign, etc.). Therefore, it is certainly possible to use these two options simultaneously when the transcriber is uncertain about their estimation.
