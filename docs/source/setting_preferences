Constraints
------------------

When you click on Constraints > Select anatomical/phonological constraints, a new window
appears. You can switch pages between Transcription Constraints, Simple Constraints, and 
Conditional Constraints using the pull-down menu. Check individual constraints you would 
like to apply to your corpus, or use the Select all/Unselect all buttons. Click OK. You
can also adjust these constraints anytime during your transcription.

Note that the constraints will NOT be automatically applied. You will need to click on 
the "Check transcription" button before saving a word.
