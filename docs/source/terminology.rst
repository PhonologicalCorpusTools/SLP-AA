.. _global_handshape_options:

Global handshape options
------------------

Global handshape options encode information about the whole sign rather than 
individual handshapes. They should be checked when relevant.

.. _hand_and_config:

Hand and Config
------------------

Hand 1 and Hand 2 are synonymous to the dominant and nondominant hands,
respectively. Config (short for configuration) refers to handshape. 
For example, Hand 1 Config 2 is the second handshape of the dominant hand. 
Depending on the signs, you do not necessarily have to fill all four of them.

.. _field_and_slot:

Field and slot
------------------
Field refers to the square brackets numbered from 1 to 7. Field 1 is a global 
handshape option (see :ref:`global_handshape_options`) for forearm involvement. 
Each of the rest is devoted to the thumb, thumb-finger contact, and the four fingers. 
Slots are square boxes inside a field.
