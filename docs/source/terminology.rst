.. _global_handshape_options:

Global handshape options
------------------

Global handshape options encode information about the whole sign. 
They should be checked when relevant.

.. _hand_and_config:

Hand and Config
------------------

Hand 1 and Hand 2 are synonymous to the dominant and nondominant hands,
respectively. Config (short for configuration) refers to handshape. 
For example, Hand 1 Config 2 is the second handshape of the dominant hand. 
Depending on the signs, you do not necessarily have to fill all four of them.

.. _field_and_slot:

Field and slot
------------------

Field refers to the square brackets numbered from 1 to 7. Slots are square boxes
inside a field. Slot 1 in Field 1 is a global handshape option (see :ref:`global_handshape_options`) 
for forearm involvement. Field 2 to 7 are devoted to the thumb, thumb-finger contact, 
and the four fingers.
If you click on any slot, information about that particular slot will appear 
at the bottom right corner.

For example, if you click on Slot 5 in Field 2, the following information will appear:

Field number is 2; Field type is Thumb; Slot number is 5; Slot type is Thumb DIP flexion; 
and permitted characters are H (hyperextended), E (extended), i (intermediate), and F (flexed).
